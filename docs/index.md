# Azurecaf provider

The Azurecaf provider is a *logical provider* which means that it works entirely within Terraform's logic, and doesn't interact with any other services. The goal of this provider is to provider helper methods in implementing Azure landing zones using Terraform.

The Azurecaf provider currently contains a single resource based on the Terraform Random_string provider. The naming_convention resources enforce consistant naming covention for a set of supported Azure services.

You may select different type of naming convention (cafclassic,cafrandom,random,passthrough) based on the environment that you target or the naming style that you need to apply. Whichever convention you select, the naming convention ensures that the generated name is compliant with the Azure service that you target.

## Resource types

We define resource types as per: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/naming-and-tagging

Current prototype supports:

| Resource type                       | Resource type code (short)  | Resource type code (long)               |
