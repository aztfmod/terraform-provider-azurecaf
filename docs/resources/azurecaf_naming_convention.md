# azurecaf_naming_convention

The resource naming_convention implements a set of methodologies to apply consistent resource naming using the default Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure recommendations as per https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/naming-and-tagging.

The naming_convention is the initial resource released as part of the azurecaf provider, the naming_convention supports a fixed set of resources as described in the documention. In order to provider more flexibility and support the large breadth of Azure resources available you can use the azurecaf_name resource.

## Example usage
This example outputs one name, the result of the naming convention query. The result attribute returns the name based on the convention and parameters input.

The example generates a 23 characters name compatible with the specification for an Azure Resource Group
dev-aztfmod-001

```hcl
resource "azurecaf_naming_convention" "cafrandom_rg" {  
  name    = "aztfmod"
  prefix  = "dev"
  resource_type    = "rg"
  postfix = "001"
  max_length = 23
  convention  = "cafrandom"
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "cafrandom" {
  name     = azurecaf_naming_convention.cafrandom_rg.result
  location = "southeastasia"
}


The provider generates a name using the input parameters and automatically appends a prefix (if defined), a caf prefix (resource type) and postfix (if defined) in addition to a generated padding string based on the selected naming convention.

```
The example above would generate a name using the pattern [prefix]-[cafprefix]-[name]-[postfix]-[padding]:

```
dev-aztfmod-rg-001-wxyz
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* name - (optional) the basename of the resource to create, the basename will be sanitized as per supported character set in Azure.
* convention (optional) - one of the four naming convention supported. Defaults to cafrandom. Allowed values are cafclassic, cafrandom, random, passthrough
* prefix (optional) - prefix to append as the first characters of the generated name
* postfix (optional) -  additional postfix added after the basename, this is can be used to append resource index (eg. vm-001)
* max_length (optional) - configure the maximum length of the returned object name, is the specified length is longer than the supported length of the Azure resource the later applies
* resource_type (optional) -  describes the type of azure resource you are requesting a name from (eg. azure container registry: acr). See the Resource Type section

# Attributes Reference
The following attributes are exported:

* id - The id of the naming convention object
* result - The generated named for an Azure Resource based on the input parameter and the selected naming convention


# Methods for naming convention

The following methods are implemented for naming conventions:

| method name | description of the naming convention used |
| -- | -- |
| cafclassic | follows Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure recommendations as per https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/naming-and-tagging |
| cafrandom | follows Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure recommendations as per https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/naming-and-tagging and adds randomly generated characters up to maximum length of name |
| random | name will be generated automatically in full lengths of azure object |
| passthrough | naming convention is implemented manually, fields given as input will be same as the output (but lengths and forbidden chars will be filtered out) |

## Resource types

We define resource types as per: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/naming-and-tagging 

Current prototype supports:

| Resource type                       | Resource type code (short)  | Resource type code (long)               |
